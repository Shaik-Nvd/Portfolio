# Hi there


My name is Shaik Naveed Ahmed, and I am a full stack developer and Student counselor.  
With expertise in backend Java development, full stack web technologies, and marketing,  
I have a strong grasp of both technical and business aspects of software development.  

I am passionate about teaching and mentoring. I run online tutorials to help degree and  
engineering students crack job interviews by blending technical skills with behavioral insights.  

In addition to technology and education, I have a deep interest in human psychology.

Type `"cd ~/projects"` then `"ls"` to see details of some of the projects I have worked on,  
where I have leveraged my technical expertise and strategic insights to drive success.
